-----------------------------------------------
BitHiro helps you travel through space in real life, digitally.BitHiro can let you be wherever you wanna be. In one day, I hope this app can really help travel through time :P

*******************************
If you enable google's location service and GPS satellites in location services, BitHiro MIGHT NOT WORK PROPERLY.
In Android 4.1 version, there is a BUG. You may not set virtual address from maps. This bug is in Android system. As long as Google fix it, the bug in BitHiro will no longer exits.

*******************************
You can compile your own bitHiro, the version without ads. But PLEASE keep your own version to YOURSELF. This app has uploaded to Google Play and some other markets.

If there are lots of people download this app, I will consider adding some new functions.
